# GeoSpy
Geospy is a geoguessr clone that allows you to play geoguessr for free!

# How to use
There are multiple ways to play this. If you are using this in your freetime, use the pages link. If you are using this at school, and your school likes to block things, go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3EqJqyKykhg95nYHsVTUioq2U3WUCkk/view?usp=sharing) and download the html. This will open the file in an iframe.

# What will be added soon?
I'm planning on adding more maps. I've added europe, and the original creator added the world and the Philippines.
